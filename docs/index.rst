Eve-SQLAlchemy
==============

This tutorial will show how to use Eve with the `SQLAlchemy`_ support. Using
`SQLAlchemy`_ instead MongoDB means that you can re-use your existing SQL data
model and expose it via REST thanks to Eve with no hassle.

.. note::
   We're currently busy preparing a major release supporting Eve 0.7 and fixing
   a lot of bugs along the way.

   If you're starting a new project and want to use this - go ahead! Just make
   sure you're using the current `master` branch to avoid the breaking changes
   in 0.5.0.
